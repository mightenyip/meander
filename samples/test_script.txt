INT. LAB – NIGHT
A cramped NEON-LIT LAB hums with servers and monitors. CABLES snake across the floor.

JESS
Okay, one more compile and then I swear I’m done touching this parser.

MARCO
(leaning over her shoulder)
Famous last words. What happens if it sees an FDX with no slug lines?

Jess taps a key. The monitors FLASH as lines of XML scroll by.

JESS
Then we write a bug ticket and pretend it was a feature request.


EXT. CITY ROOFTOP – DAWN
The sun creeps over the skyline. A small DRONE hovers at the edge of the roof.

MARCO
If your script analyzer can find this scene, it can find anything.

JESS
I’m logging location, time of day, and every character per scene. The drone even gets a credit.

The drone BEEPS and nods as if in agreement.


INT. EDIT BAY – DAY
Multiple MONITORS show timelines, color wheels, and script pages side by side.

RILEY
So this app of yours can highlight every line for a single character?

JESS
(points at the screen)
Yep. Pick a character, export a script just for them. Editors, actors, even casting can use it.

RILEY
Nice. Does it handle overlapping scenes and flashbacks?

MARCO
We’re calling that version two, so we can still ship version one.


EXT. CITY STREET – NIGHT
Traffic WHOOSHES by. Jess walks, staring at a tablet running the SCRIPT ANALYZER APP.

JESS
Scene count... four. Characters per scene... three here, two on the roof, plus one very proud drone.

RILEY
And our test user?

JESS
Some poor developer trying to parse this FDX file.

CUT TO BLACK.
